## :pushpin: About this project
:recycle: **Ecoleta** is a platform which helps people find waste collection points, aiming to facilitate the correct disposal.

It is composed by two main modules: :computer: **web** and :iphone: **mobile**, in addiction to a :cloud: **RESTful API** as backend for both applications.

This project was built during the first edition of **[Next Level Week](https://nextlevelweek.com/)**.

> Big thanks to [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) and [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g) for holding this event!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technologies
:cloud: For API REST: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

:computer: For web: [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)

:iphone: For mobile: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.io/)

:tada: In general: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## :rocket: How to run the platform
> :bulb: It is worth mentioning that both web and mobile apps need the backend server running to work properly. Keeping that in mind, let's go ahead...

### :eyes: Prerequisites
First thing first, you are going to need to have installed in your machine [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Optionally, if you wish to edit the code, I would recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

With the prerequisites installed, the next step is to clone the project.
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/victor-kayan/ecoleta
```

### :boom: Run backend
```bash
# Change to the server directory
$ cd ecoleta/server

# Install the dependencies packages
$ npm install
# Or...
$ yarn

# Run server in development mode
$ npm run dev
# Or...
$ yarn dev
```

### :eight_spoked_asterisk: Run web application
```bash
# Change to the web directory
$ cd ecoleta/web

# Install the dependencies packages
$ npm install
# Or...
$ yarn

# Run website in development mode
$ npm run start
# Or...
$ yarn start

# The application will run on port 3000. Access http://localhost:3000
```

### :star2: Run mobile device application
> :construction: Not available yet... :construction:
